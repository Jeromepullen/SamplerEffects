# Sampler Effects

iOS App using Swift that allows users to record a sound using the deviceâ€™s microphone. It then allows users to play the recorded sound back with six different sound modulations.

-The app uses code from Apple's AVFoundation API to record sounds from the microphone (AVAudioRecorder) and play recorded audio with effects (AVAudioPlayer, AVAudioEngine).

## Implementation
Sampler Effects has two Scenes: 
- **RecordSoundsViewController** : consists a record button with a microphone image.
- **PlaySoundsViewController** : contains six buttons to play the recorded sound file with different effects related to the button image and a stop button at the bottom

*The App supports all UI elements (buttons and text) are appropriately formatted for iPhone and iPad Portrait and Landscape layouts.*

*The App uses `UINavigationController` to navigate between these two scenes.*
